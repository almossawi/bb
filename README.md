# Bookshelf Buddy
Ever had trouble finding books on a bookshelf? Snap a photo and have Bookshelf Buddy create searchable copies of them for you. Archive your shelves so that you can go back and see how your taste might have changed over time. You can pre-order it on the App Store today. I'm targeting October 2024 for a release.

I'll open source the code and the app will be free to use.

Be well,
